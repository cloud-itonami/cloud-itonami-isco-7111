(ns housebuilder.advisor
  "House Builder Advisor — proposing a job-site scheduling/logistics
  coordination operation (log a work record, schedule a crew
  operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate a building-materials
  supply order) from a crew roster, job-site registration and
  safety-reporting policy. Swappable mock/llm; the advisor ONLY
  proposes — `housebuilder.governor` independently gates every
  proposal and always escalates safety concerns and above-threshold
  supply orders. The advisor never proposes to directly finalize a
  structural-work-execution decision (e.g. a specific framing or
  foundation step) or to override a site safety officer's/foreman's
  judgment — those stay permanently out of this actor's scope.
  Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-3313's advisor (and closely on
  cloud-itonami-isco-9311's mininglabor.advisor for the
  physical-safety-domain shape).
